# Welcome!

My name is Giacomo Manferdini and I am a first-year PhD studenti at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu). My research interests lie in labor, political, behavioral, and public economics.

Previously, after getting a M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Bologna, I worked as research assistant at the University of Bonn for [Lorenz Goette](https://www.iame.uni-bonn.de/people/lorenz-goette) and [Egon Tripodi](https://www.egontripodi.com). For more details, have a look at my [CV](../assets/cv/Manferdini_CV.pdf)
